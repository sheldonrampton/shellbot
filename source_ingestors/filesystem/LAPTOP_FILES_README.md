## sheldonmrampton
### Dale
A copy of Dale's old website.

### Databases
- A "Contacts" database that is apparently a Palm Desktop Address Book backup from October 1999.
- A DevonThink database that I'm having trouble opening.

### Downloads
- Miscellaneous file downloads, some of which might be worth preserving but which were generally downloaded for ephemeral purposes.

### Dropbox
- Some files related to "Bad Burrito."

### go
- Some golang stuff? I don't care about this.

### Google Drive

#### My Drive
- Mirrors the "My Drive" folder on the cloud for Google Drive.
Mostly contains pointers to the full documents rather than the
actual documents. Contains ~200 documents, ranging from essays
other musings to receipts and similarly mundane things.
- It would probably be better to get these documents from Google
Drive rather than try to pull them from this folder.

### hap
-  A copy of the old website for Hap Smith.

### not iCloud
- A bunch of files that probably exist elsewhere, such as copies of my books.

### photos no Cloud
- Photos from family, WCCN, and elsewhere. Most probably exist in iPhoto.

### Public
#### VoodooPad
- Stuff

### Sheldon
- Includes an HTML version of my old sheldonrampton.com website with some blog posts I'd like to preserve.

### Sites
- Old codebases (Drupal, mostly) related to website I built for people like Laura Miller, as well as some image, video and PDFs. If I want to find content for these sites, it's probably best to pull them from archive.org.
